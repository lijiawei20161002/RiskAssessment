# Overview

I propose building an interactive, web-based risk assessment tool using Python and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). The app will allow users to input empirical measurements (e.g., benchmark scores, evaluation results, incident reports) via adjustable controls (e.g., sliders, text boxes). These inputs will be mapped to parameters of a simple AI risk model for cybersecurity, which considers:

1. **N:** Number of attack attempts  
2. **P₁:** Probability of a successful spearphishing attempt  
3. **P₂:** Probability of successful malware development & deployment  
4. **P₃:** Probability of successful persistence & achievement of objectives  
5. **Severity:** Economic damage per successful attack  

The core calculation will be:  
**Risk Estimate = N × P₁ × P₂ × P₃ × Severity**

To capture uncertainty and illustrate probability propagation, the app will run a Monte Carlo simulation—allowing each parameter to be treated as a distribution (e.g., uniform or normal). The output will show:
- A point estimate for expected damage
- A probability distribution (e.g., histogram) of economic damage outcomes

# Key Features

- **Interactive UI:** Users adjust inputs (empirical proxies) to see real-time risk estimate updates.
- **Monte Carlo Simulation:** Propagates uncertainty across parameters.
- **Visual Outputs:** Graphs displaying both the point estimate and distribution of potential damages.
- **Modular Design:** Easily extendable to incorporate additional parameters or alternative risk models.
